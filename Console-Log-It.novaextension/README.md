<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "Log This" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the features your extension provides. For example:
-->

**Console.log It** wraps the word your cursor is on in a console.log.

<!--
ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

To run Log This:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Console.log It** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Console.log It`; or
- Use the hotkey: â‡§âŒ˜L

ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!

P.S. If you'd like, you can remove these comments before submitting your extension ðŸ˜‰
